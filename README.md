# pyDentateeLife2020

This is a legacy repository dedicated to the reproducibility of our findings from Braganza et al. "Quantitative properties of a feedback circuit predict frequency-dependent pattern separation" eLife, 2020 http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53148
that were generated with pyDentate. If you want to use or build on pyDentate it is highly recommended to use the [active pyDentate repository](https://github.com/danielmk/pyDentate).

# Running pyDentateeLife2020 legacy version

Follow these steps to run this legacy version of pyDentate:
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution">Anaconda</a></li>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron">NEURON</a>
  <p>There are many ways to install NEURON. I prefer the <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/neuron">conda-forge</a> distribution<blockquote>
        <p>conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 neuron</p>
    </blockquote></p>
</li>
<li>Install elephant
  <p><blockquote>pip install elephant</blockquote></li></p>
<li><a href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/compile_mswin">Compile the NEURON mechanisms</a> in /mechs_7-6</li>
<li>Download the pyDentateeLife2020 repository and unpack</li>
<li>Open paradigm_pattern_separation.py and add the path to your compiled mechanisms to dll_files variable</li>
<li>Run paradigm_pattern_separation.py</li>
</ol>

# pyDentate structure

paradigm_ files are scripts that create one or more networks, run them and save the results. net_ files contain the network classes that are used by scripts to create the networks. Other files define for example the input pattern generator (burst_generator_inhomogeneous_poisson.py) or the single cells specifications (granulecell.py with granuelcellparams.txt). ouropy provides a backend for the networks by defining the logic to create and connect networks. I custom made ouropy to move away from NEURONS Section logic to a higher-level logic of cells, populations, connections and finally networks. Networks in net_ files inherit from ouropys GenNetwork class. For more details on pyDentate make sure to look at the [active pyDentate repository](https://github.com/danielmk/pyDentate).
